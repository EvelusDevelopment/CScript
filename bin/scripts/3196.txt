Offset: 85, PUSHS , Operand: Help - security
Offset: 86, STORESTR , Operand: 0
Offset: 87, PUSHS , Operand: Giving out your contact information in-game can put the security of your account at risk. There are some unscrupulous people out there, so, to protect your account and your privacy, it makes sense not to give your details to anyone you don't know.

Offset: 98, STORESTR , Operand: 0
