Offset: 48, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 49, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 50, PUSHS , Operand: Last reports place him in a cavern in the Gu'Tanoth region. He's searching for herbs to control his excruciating toothache.

Offset: 63, PUSHS , Operand: Code name: 'Bad Daddy':
Offset: 64, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 65, PUSHS , Operand: The main villain; he needs to be stopped.
Offset: 66, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 67, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 68, PUSHS , Operand:  Located in a separated off section of Zanaris, he's discovered a weakness in the interplanar fabric. This is really bad news for us!

Offset: 70, PUSHI , Operand: 63701005
Offset: 71, Unref Method: 2112, Operand: 0
Offset: 72, PUSHS , Operand: 'Bad Daddy' has used his magic and the magic of the Fairy Queen to make a rift between this plane and another seemingly filled with orks. He's using the rift to transport orks through to use as henchmen.
Offset: 73, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 74, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 75, PUSHS , Operand: The Godfather is invulnerable to any standard attack. His magic is somehow linked to orks, so we suspect some sort of weakness there.

Offset: 79, PUSHS , Operand: Ork teeth: Crude and brutal, these masticating marvels convey a feeling of basic primal energy.
Offset: 80, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 81, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 82, PUSHS , Operand: What they lack in quality, they more than make up for in their wonderfully coarse, brutal and businesslike functionality.

Offset: 86, PUSHS , Operand: In the host's early years, the tooth comes to an excessively tantalising point! 
Offset: 87, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 88, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 89, PUSHS , Operand: As the host grazes most of the time, this quickly gets worn down. 
Offset: 90, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 91, PUSHS , Operand: <br>
Offset: 92, PUSHS , Operand: Opinion is divided, but many believe the more interesting teeth come from those orks more accustomed to combat. A broken tooth sometimes creates a sublime 'organic' structure - smooth and discoloured, but dense.
